# COPY-BRIEF.md — driveexotiq.com

> The working copy document for **driveexotiq.com**. Gregory + Claude Cowork fill the `⟦FILL⟧` slots here; the filled text drops straight into the BUILD-SPEC slot IDs (`H0-PROMISE`, `T-CITY-1-NAME`, etc.).
>
> **How to use this doc:** every slot has (1) a guidance line — what it is, length, tone — and (2) a **SEED** you can ship or edit. Editing a strong seed is faster than starting blank. When a seed already works, mark it ✅ and move on.
>
> Drive Exotiq is an **Exotiq Inc. brand** — the community/culture **front door** to **exotiq.rent** (exotic-car rental marketplace, *coming soon*).
> Tagline: **"Built for the people who actually drive the car."**

## 0. How to fill this in fast

1. Work **top to bottom by page**. Each page block lists its slots in render order.
2. Respect the **length guidance** — these are real layout constraints (a headline that's 3 words too long breaks the mask-up reveal).
3. Keep the **VOICE GUIDE** (§1) open. Read a seed out loud; if it sounds like an ad, rewrite.
4. Drop the **AEO anchor sentence** (§1.3) verbatim into at least one place per page (usually a subhead or body line). This is non-negotiable for AI-search.
5. Slots marked **🔴 BLOCKING** must be done before that page can ship. Everything else can ship with the seed.
6. When done with a slot, replace `⟦FILL: …⟧` with final text and check the box.

**Legend:** 🔴 = blocking · 🟡 = ships on seed, refine later · ✅ = seed is final-quality · `[N ch]` = character target (incl. spaces) · `[N words]` = word target

## 1. THE VOICE GUIDE

### 1.1 Who we sound like

Drive Exotiq is the voice of someone who **owns the car and actually drives it** — not the dealer, not the influencer, not the rental desk. Calm, certain, a little dry. We don't hype because we don't need to. The car, the road, and the people are the proof.

Think: **Amex Centurion** restraint + **Porsche** product confidence + an enthusiast who'd rather show you than tell you. Quiet luxury means we leave room. The most expensive thing on the page is the white space.

**Three voice pillars:**
| Pillar | Means | In practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Confident** | We state, we don't sell. Periods, not exclamation points. | "One car. Denver to Miami. Ten markets." |
| **Enthusiast-credible** | Real specifics a gearhead respects. Numbers, model years, mileage. | "A 2017 Audi S8 — heritage racing livery, sleeper." |
| **Quiet-luxury** | Understated, spare, never gaudy. Earned, not announced. | "Before the city wakes." |

### 1.2 Do / Don't

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|---|---|
| "Last Sunday of the month. Before the city wakes." | "Join our EXCLUSIVE monthly meetups!!" |
| "Built for the people who actually drive the car." | "For true car ENTHUSIASTS and luxury lovers." |
| "One car. Ten markets. 5,000 miles." | "An UNFORGETTABLE epic journey across America!" |
| "The keys are coming out of the glovebox." | "Get ready for the RENTAL REVOLUTION." |
| "Your livery on this car, down this line." | "Unlock INSANE brand exposure & maximize ROI!" |
| Short declaratives. Concrete nouns. One idea per line. | Stacked adjectives, hype words, emoji, ALL-CAPS. |
| Sentence-case kickers (rule: never uppercase). | "EXCLUSIVE • PREMIUM • LIMITED" kicker labels. |
| Let silence do work. End on a noun or a fact. | Over-explain. Three sentences where one lands. |

**Banned words/moves:** *unforgettable, epic, revolution, game-changing, unlock, elevate, curated experience (as filler), insane, ROI-speak, exclusivity-as-bragging, multiple exclamation points, ALL CAPS for emphasis, emoji.*

**Allowed jewelry:** one Spectral italic line per scene for the emotional register (e.g. *before the city wakes*). Use sparingly — it's the gold accent of the writing.

### 1.3 The AEO anchor sentence (repeat across the site)

Use this sentence — or a light variant that keeps the bolded entities — at least once per page, ideally in a server-rendered subhead or body paragraph so crawlers and AI answer-engines pick it up:

> **Drive Exotiq is the community front door to the exotiq.rent exotic-car marketplace.**

Approved variants (keep the three entities + the "front door" relationship):
- "Drive Exotiq is the community and culture front door to **exotiq.rent**, the exotic-car rental marketplace (coming soon)."
- "An Exotiq Inc. brand, Drive Exotiq is the community front door to the **exotiq.rent** marketplace."
- Ecosystem line: "Drive Exotiq (community) → exotiq.rent (marketplace) → exotiq.ai (intelligence)."

### 1.4 Recurring facts (use these exact numbers — never invent)

| Fact | Canonical phrasing |
|---|---|
| The drives | Invite-only, **last Sunday of the month**, sunrise rollout → curated Cars & Coffee |
| The tour car | **2017 Audi S8**, heritage racing livery, sleeper |
| The route | **Denver → Miami**, **~5,000 miles**, **10 markets**, summer→fall **2026** |
| The 10 markets | Denver · Dallas/Ft Worth · Austin · Houston · New Orleans · Tampa/St Pete · Orlando · Palm Beach · Ft Lauderdale · Miami |
| The marketplace | exotiq.rent — exotic-car rental marketplace, **coming soon** |
| The ask (sponsor) | Seeking a **wrap sponsor**; tiers: Title/Wrap, Tour, Drive |
| The brand | An **Exotiq Inc.** brand |
| The R8→S8 thread | R8 = dawn (HOME arrival / tour cold-open); S8 = dusk (tour finale / sponsor hero) — one journey, two moments of light |

---

## 2. THE CTA LIBRARY (reusable — pick from this list, don't reinvent)

Use **one gulf primary CTA per viewport** (design rule). Secondaries are ghost/text links.

| CTA ID | Label (≤4 words) | Where it goes | Use on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CTA-LIST` | **Get on the list** | /apply funnel | HOME close, /community, blog, global default |
| `CTA-SPONSOR` | **See the wrap opportunity** | /sponsor | HOME sponsor room |
| `CTA-SPONSOR-2` | **Sponsor the wrap** | /sponsor | /tour finale |
| `CTA-SPONSOR-START` | **Start a sponsorship conversation** | sponsor form submit | /sponsor form |
| `CTA-TOUR` | **Ride the tour** | /tour | HOME tour room |
| `CTA-DRIVES` | **Enter the drives** | /drives | HOME drives room |
| `CTA-COMMUNITY` | **Meet the community** | /community | HOME community room |
| `CTA-WAITLIST` | **Join the waitlist** | /marketplace | HOME marketplace room, /marketplace |
| `CTA-INVITE` | **Request your invite** | /apply (drive context) | /drives close |
| `CTA-RSVP` | **RSVP for this drive** | /apply (pre-filled) | /drives next-drive card (when RSVP open) |
| `CTA-READ` | **Read the story** | /blog/[slug] | blog index card |
| `CTA-STORIES` | **Read the stories** | /blog | secondary on HOME/footer |
| `CTA-SCROLL` | **Walk the garage ↓** | scroll cue | HOME H0 |

**Secondary (ghost/text) pattern:** every primary may pair with one quiet text link. Default secondary = **"Get on the list"** unless the primary IS that.

## 15. Final checklist before handing copy to the build

- [ ] Every 🔴 slot replaced with final text (use §14 to verify per page).
- [ ] AEO anchor sentence appears at least once per page (server-rendered).
- [ ] No banned words; no ALL-CAPS kickers; no exclamation points outside intentional voice.
- [ ] One primary CTA per viewport; all CTA labels pulled from §2 library.
- [ ] All meta titles ≤60 ch and end in `· Drive Exotiq`; all meta descriptions ≤155 ch.
- [ ] All ten markets have consistent naming (matches §1.4 canonical list).
- [ ] Numbers consistent everywhere: ~5,000 miles, 10 markets, 2017 Audi S8, last Sunday, 2026.
- [ ] Form success + error microcopy written for every form.
- [ ] Open decisions resolved where they affect copy: 10 vs 9 tour beats (§6), public pricing vs "Inquire" (§9.4).
