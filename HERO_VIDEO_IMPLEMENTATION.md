## 🎯 Where to Save Your Video

**Your file:** `Telluride-short.mp4`

**Save it here:**
```
public/videos/Telluride-short.mp4
```

**Full path:**
```
/Users/g.r./.cursor/worktrees/driveexotiqweb-claude-build-drive-exotiq-website-019ZJQmUZm3CkAHaqJotGJ14/jcs/public/videos/Telluride-short.mp4
```

---

## 🚀 Three Ways to Get Started

### Method 1: Automated Script (Easiest!) ⭐

```bash
# 1. Save your video to public/videos/
# 2. Navigate to the folder
cd public/videos

# 3. Run the script
./optimize-video.sh Telluride-short.mp4

# 4. Done! 🎉
```

The script will create all 4 optimized versions automatically.

---

### Method 2: Manual FFmpeg Commands

```bash
cd public/videos

# Run each command (takes ~10 minutes total)
ffmpeg -i Telluride-short.mp4 -vf "scale=1280:720" -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset slow -an -movflags +faststart hero-mobile.mp4

ffmpeg -i Telluride-short.mp4 -vf "scale=1280:720" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 32 -b:v 0 -an hero-mobile.webm

ffmpeg -i Telluride-short.mp4 -vf "scale=1920:1080" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset slow -an -movflags +faststart hero-desktop.mp4

ffmpeg -i Telluride-short.mp4 -vf "scale=1920:1080" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -an hero-desktop.webm
```

---

### Method 3: Quick Test (Skip Optimization)

For immediate testing without optimization:

```bash
cd public/videos

# Just copy your original file 4 times
cp Telluride-short.mp4 hero-desktop.mp4
cp Telluride-short.mp4 hero-desktop.webm
cp Telluride-short.mp4 hero-mobile.mp4
cp Telluride-short.mp4 hero-mobile.webm
```

**Note:** Files won't be optimized, but video will work for testing.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After adding videos:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then test:

- [ ] Video loads and autoplays on desktop
- [ ] Video loops seamlessly (no jump)
- [ ] No audio plays
- [ ] Poster image appears first
- [ ] Smooth transition to video (~1 second fade)
- [ ] Video pauses when scrolling down 70% of viewport
- [ ] Video resumes when scrolling back up
- [ ] Mobile version loads on small screens (check DevTools)
- [ ] Looks good with current gradient overlay
- [ ] Hero content (text/buttons) remains visible

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Video Brightness
In `components/sections/HeroVideo.tsx`, line 66:

```tsx
// Current brightness
className="... brightness-[0.3] ..."

// Darker: brightness-[0.2]
// Lighter: brightness-[0.4]
```

### Adjust Scroll Pause Trigger
In `components/sections/HeroVideo.tsx`, line 44:

```tsx
// Current: pauses at 70% scroll
if (window.scrollY > window.innerHeight * 0.7) {

// Later: window.innerHeight * 0.9
// Earlier: window.innerHeight * 0.5
```

### Disable Video (Revert to Static)
Just comment out the video in `components/sections/Hero.tsx`:

```tsx
// <HeroVideo />
```

And add back the Image component.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Video Length:** Keep it 10-15 seconds for optimal file size
- **Content:** Smooth, slow-motion shots work best
- **Colors:** Darker/moodier footage complements the overlay
- **Motion:** Avoid jerky camera movements
- **Loop Point:** Plan the start/end frames to loop seamlessly

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Video doesn't load
- Check file names exactly match: `hero-mobile.mp4`, `hero-desktop.mp4`, etc.
- Check files are in `public/videos/` directory
- Open browser console (F12) for error messages

### Video is too large
- Increase CRF value in FFmpeg command (higher = smaller file)
- Reduce video length
- Lower resolution

### Video looks pixelated
- Decrease CRF value (lower = better quality)
- Check source video quality
- Verify correct resolution was used

### Video doesn't loop smoothly
- Add fade effect at start/end (see VIDEO_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md)
- Check source video has clean loop point

---

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Lighthouse Scores (Estimated)
- Performance: 85-90 (with optimized videos)
- Accessibility: 95+
- Best Practices: 95+
- SEO: 100

### Load Times (4G Connection)
- Initial poster image: <1 second
- Video start playing: 2-3 seconds
- Full video buffered: 5-8 seconds

---

**Status:** ✅ Implementation complete, waiting for video files  
**Fallback:** Currently showing static Bugatti image (production-ready)  
**Ready to deploy:** Yes, with or without videos
