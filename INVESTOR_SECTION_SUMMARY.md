## 🎯 Conversion Strategy

The investor section is designed as a **conversion funnel:**

1. **Homepage Teaser** → Creates awareness, teases opportunity
2. **Investors Page** → Builds FOMO, establishes credibility
3. **CTAs** → Drives to deck viewing and calendar booking
4. **Email** → Captures those who want more info first

**Goal:** Get qualified investors to either:
- View the full deck (high intent)
- Book a call with you (highest intent)
- Email for AngelList link (medium intent)

**Implementation Complete! 🎉**

The investor section is now live and ready to convert early-stage investors interested in premium mobility infrastructure.
