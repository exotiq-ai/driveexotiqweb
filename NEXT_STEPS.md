# 🎯 Next Steps - What You Need to Do

Hi! Your Drive Exotiq website is now fully built with Supabase integration and an admin dashboard. Here's what you need to do to get it running:

---

## ⚡ Quick Path (10 Minutes)

Follow this streamlined path to get up and running fast:

### 1. Get Your Supabase Credentials (3 min)

You mentioned you already have a Supabase project. Get your credentials:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) → **API**
3. Copy these three values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **service_role key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### 2. Create `.env.local` File (1 min)

Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=paste_your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=paste_your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=paste_your_service_role_key_here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChooseASecurePassword123
```

**Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials!

### 3. Create the Database Table (2 min)

1. In Supabase, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Open [`DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
4. Copy the entire SQL script from that file
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
7. You should see: "Success. No rows returned" ✅

### 4. Start and Test (4 min)

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then test:
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/apply`
2. Fill out and submit the form
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
4. Login with your admin password
5. See your test application! ✅
