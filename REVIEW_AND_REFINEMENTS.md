## Issues Found 🔍

### INCONSISTENCIES (Need Fixing):

1. **"Get Vetted" Still Appears in 3 Places:**
   - `app/apply/page.tsx` line 11 - metadata description
   - `components/sections/HowItWorks.tsx` line 9 - "Apply & Get Vetted" title
   - `components/sections/FinalCTA.tsx` line 15 - "Get vetted" in CTA copy

2. **Gregory's Headshot Format Inconsistency:**
   - File saved as `.jpg` but is actually PNG format (1000x1000 PNG)
   - Should either rename to `.png` or convert to JPEG for consistency
   - PNG is 785KB (larger than needed for web)

### MINOR WARNINGS (Non-Critical):
- React Hook dependency warnings (existing, not from our changes)
- `<img>` tag warnings in Logo component (intentional for SVG fix)

## Recommended Refinements 🔧

### Priority 1: Fix "Get Vetted" Inconsistencies
**Files to update:**
1. `app/apply/page.tsx` - Change metadata description
2. `components/sections/HowItWorks.tsx` - Change title to "Apply & Join the Community"
3. `components/sections/FinalCTA.tsx` - Change "Get vetted" to "Join the community"

### Priority 2: Optimize Gregory's Headshot
**Options:**
- A) Rename to `gregory-ringler.png` (accurate but less common)
- B) Convert to JPEG and optimize to ~100-150KB (recommended for web performance)
- C) Leave as-is (works but inconsistent naming)

### Priority 3: Consider Adding Alt Text
- Team headshots could use more descriptive alt text
- Currently empty alt="" - could be "Gregory Ringler, Founder & CEO"

## Build Status ✅

- ✅ Build successful (no errors)
- ⚠️ 5 warnings (all pre-existing, non-critical)
- ✅ All pages render correctly
- ✅ All images load properly

## Recommendation 💡

**Should we fix these issues before pushing?**

1. Update the 3 remaining "Get Vetted" references - **5 minutes**
2. Optionally convert Gregory's PNG to optimized JPEG - **2 minutes**

Total estimated time: **~7 minutes**

This will ensure complete consistency with the "Join the Community" messaging strategy.
