## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Instagram URL"
- Make sure you're copying the full URL
- URL must contain `/p/` or `/reel/`
- Test the URL in a browser first

### Image doesn't load
- Instagram occasionally blocks embed images
- Try re-adding the post
- Check that the post is public (not private)

### Posts not showing on homepage
- Check that posts are marked as "Active"
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Ensure at least 1 post is active

### Can't access admin page
- Login to `/admin` first
- Use your admin password
- Session expires when browser closes
